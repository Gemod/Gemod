# 👋 Hi, I'm Gennaro!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub — where code meets creativity.

I've been coding since I was 15, and that spark never faded. Today, I'm a **senior developer** @Altermaind with a deep love for clean architecture, meaningful automation, and tools that make digital life smoother.

## 💻 Code is my language, curiosity my fuel

Whether it's building microservices in Quarkus or crafting tools for creators, I love making complex things feel simple.  
Lately, I’ve been diving headfirst into **Kubernetes**, and I’m genuinely excited about everything it unlocks — scalability, resilience, magic. Still learning, always experimenting.

✍️ **Tools for Copywriters and Creators**  
From AI-powered brainstorming to smart formatting scripts, brainstorming new ideas. 


🚀 **Bonus
You will find all the personal projects, technologies that intrigue me, entire learning paths on new technologies that I am exploring with examples and theory.
